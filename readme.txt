INTRODUCTION

CHEssentials is intended to be a functional replacement for the Essentials CraftBukkit plugin, written entirely in CommandHelper.

This is a CommandHelper community project and anyone may contribute, whether by discussing on this thread or becoming more deeply involved.

Because CHEssentials is an in-progress functional Essentials replacement it...
 * Isn't a true clone.
 * Aims to use the same Essentials permissions nodes, and...
 * Aims to use the same commands as the equivalent Essentials command, but...
 * Includes some improvements and differences (mainly where the community feels something can be done better)
 * Is a work in progress... Many parts haven't been done yet.
 * Needs volunteers! Whether developing or helping to organize and administer.

The main thrust of CHEssentials is Essentials commands. Other modules, such as AntiBuild, Economy and Signs, will need volunteers specifically interested in working on that area.
